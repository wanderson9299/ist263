                <h2>Sunset Cruise:</h2>
                <p>When spending time on the water in Marblehead, the best time of the day is the hour before and after sunset.  At this time the water usually turns flat and the majority of people head in for the night.  The sky turns orange and red lighting up the beautiful coastline.  Make your way around the harbor and surrounding islands for some of the best views mother nature has to offer.</p>

                <h2>Seals:</h2>
                <p>If you are looking to see some local wildlife there is a colony of seals that lives off the coast of Marblehead.  Take a right out of Marblehead Harbor and stay to the ocean side of all the islands due to hidden rocks.  Head past Tinkers Island for a few minutes and you will come across two large rocks.  There is a colony of seals who live there, just stay clear of the seals and rocks when driving your boat.</p>

                <h2>Marblehead Lighthouse:</h2>
                <p>The most significant landmark of Marblehead sits out on the point of the neck.  This is an amazing place to head by boat and take in an oceanside view.  You can also head there by car and look out into the surrounding waters.  This area is the claim to how Marblehead got its name, when ships sailed in the red rocks looked like marble.  They would say "Marble Ahead" when making their way to land.</p>

                <h2>Browns Island:</h2>
                <p>This place is the pinnacle of summer days in Marblehead.  People from all over flock to this island to spend the day on the water.  Here you can anchor up and relax.  You can swim around in the shallow water and even head to the island to spend time at the beach or go for a hike.  Just beware of the tides because there is always someone who gets their boat stuck on the beach when the tide heads out.</p>
